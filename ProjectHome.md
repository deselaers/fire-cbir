# Overview #

FIRE, the Flexible Image Retrieval Engine, is an image retrieval system designed for research in this area. It is focus on evaluating different image descriptors, not on indices for efficient search.

It was mainly developed by Thomas Deselaers during his diploma and Phd Theses at the Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition Group at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.
